    <h1>Great Movies You Might Have Never Heard Of</h1>

    <p>Being a big fan of cinema, I watch many movies every year. Some produced that year, some that I might have missed from the past. This is a small collection of some excellent, under the radar movies that I watched in 2016. The criteria that I used to select these movies include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The film cannot have grossed more than $5 million at the box office</li>
      <li>It must have a Rotten Tomatoes critic rating of at least 70%</li>
      <li>It must have been released in the past 5 years</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the movies that made the cut:</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com">Rotten Tomatoes</a> is a site that I use quite frequently to check scores from critics. To be honest, I don't particularly like the layout and design of the site. I feel that it is due for a refresh, in an effort to make it look less cluttered and busy. I think that the individual movie pages look good enough though, for the most part. </p>

    <p>As far as the source code for the page, it is very heavy with Javascript, so I don't necessarily understand most of that section. The HTML tags though are familiar to me, and it's interesting to get in there and actually read it all.</p>
